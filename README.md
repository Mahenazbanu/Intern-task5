Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark.



# Network Traffic Capture & Analysis with Wireshark

This project demonstrates how to capture and analyze live network traffic using **Wireshark**, focusing on identifying common protocols and understanding communication patterns in a modern network environment.

## üéØ Objective
The goal of this task is to:
- Gain hands-on experience capturing live network traffic.
- Identify and understand different network protocols in use.
- Analyze packet data to recognize typical communication behaviors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Wireshark** (Free and open-source network protocol analyzer)

## üìÅ Deliverables
1. A packet capture file: `network_capture.pcap`
2. A summary report detailing observed protocols and network behavior

---

## üß™ Task Steps Performed

1. Installed **Wireshark** on the analysis machine.
2. Started packet capture on the active network interface.
3. Generated traffic by browsing websites and streaming media.
4. Stopped capture after approximately one minute.
5. Applied display filters to isolate specific protocols (e.g., TCP, DNS, QUIC).
6. Identified at least 3 distinct protocols in the captured data.
7. Exported the full capture as `network_capture.pcap`.
8. Summarized findings based on the observed packet details.

## üìä Summary of Findings

> **Analysis Date:** Monday, June 2  
> **Analyst Name:** Mahenaz  
> **Capture File:** `network_capture.pcap`

### üîç Protocol Breakdown

| Protocol   | Packet Count |
|------------|--------------|
| TCP        | 4,982        |
| QUIC       | 3,796        |
| TLSv1.3    | 2,715        |
| ICMPv6     | 224          |
| DNS        | 186          |
| OCSP       | 98           |
| ARP        | 14           |
| HTTP       | 4            |

### üåê Key Observations

- **IPv6 Dominance:** Over 11,000 IPv6 frames were observed, indicating a mature IPv6-enabled network environment.
- **Encrypted Communication:** Widespread use of **TLSv1.3** and **QUIC**, showing strong preference for secure and efficient transport protocols.
- **Minimal Legacy Protocols:** Only 4 unencrypted HTTP packets detected, reflecting modern security practices.
- **Local Discovery:** Normal local network operations were seen via **ARP** and **ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery**.

### üö¶ Identified Services

| Service                  | Protocol(s) Used             | Description                                               |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Encrypted Web Browsing   | HTTPS, TLSv1.3               | Secure access to websites                                 |
| Video Streaming          | QUIC                         | Likely YouTube or Google services over HTTP/3              |
| Domain Resolution        | DNS over UDP                 | Standard domain name lookups                              |
| Certificate Validation   | OCSP                         | SSL/TLS certificate status checks                         |
| Local Network Discovery  | ARP, ICMPv6                  | Layer 2 and IPv6 neighbor discovery                       |
